11. **Find Maximum and Minimum in an Array**
    - Write a program to find the maximum and minimum values in an array using a loop.

12. **Count Digits in a Number**
    - Write a program to count the number of digits in a given number using a loop.

13. **Find GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)**
    - Write a program to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using a loop.

14. **Check Palindrome**
    - Write a program to check if a given string or number is a palindrome using a loop.

15. **Print a Square of Stars**
    - Print a square matrix of stars (e.g., 5x5) using nested loops.
    ```
    *****
    *****
    *****
    *****
    *****
    ```

### **Advanced Loop Questions**

16. **Find Prime Numbers in a Range**
    - Write a program to print all prime numbers in a range from `a` to `b` using a loop.

17. **Find All Divisors of a Number**
    - Write a program to find and print all divisors of a number `n` using a loop.

18. **Sum of Digits of a Number**
    - Write a program to calculate the sum of digits of a number `n` using a loop.

19. **Pattern of Numbers (Nested Loops)**
    - Print a number pattern like the following using nested loops:
      ```
      1
      1 2
      1 2 3
      1 2 3 4
      ```

20. **Matrix Transpose**
    - Write a program to find the transpose of a 2D matrix using nested loops.

21. **Sum of Odd Digits in a Number**
    - Write a program to calculate the sum of all odd digits in a given number using a loop.

22. **Count Vowels and Consonants**
    - Write a program to count the number of vowels and consonants in a given string using a loop.

23. **Reverse an Array**
    - Write a program to reverse the elements of an array using a loop.

24. **Print a Number Pattern**
    - Write a program to print the following number pattern:
      ```
      1
      12
      123
      1234
      ```

25. **Multiplication of Matrix (Nested Loops)**
