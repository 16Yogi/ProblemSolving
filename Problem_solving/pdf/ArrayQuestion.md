Here is a progression of array-related questions, moving from basic to advanced:

### **Basic Questions**

1. **Array Sum**  
   Write a program to find the sum of all elements in an array.

2. **Array Length**  
   Write a program to find the length of an array without using the built-in length function.

3. **Find Maximum Element**  
   Write a program to find the maximum element in an array.

4. **Find Minimum Element**  
   Write a program to find the minimum element in an array.

5. **Reverse Array**  
   Given an array, reverse its elements in place (without using a second array).

6. **Check for Even/Odd**  
   Write a program to check if all elements in an array are even or odd.

7. **Count Occurrences**  
   Given an array, count the occurrences of a specific number in the array.

8. **Array Comparison**  
   Write a program to check if two arrays are equal (same elements in the same order).

### **Intermediate Questions**

9. **Duplicate Elements**  
   Write a program to check if an array contains any duplicate elements.

10. **Second Largest Element**  
    Write a program to find the second largest element in an array.

11. **Array Rotation**  
    Rotate the elements of an array to the right by `k` positions. Implement a function to do this.

12. **Find Missing Number**  
    Given an array of `n-1` integers in the range from 1 to `n`, find the missing number.

13. **Move Zeros to End**  
    Write a program to move all zeros in an array to the end without changing the order of non-zero elements.

14. **Merge Two Arrays**  
    Write a program to merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array.

15. **Find Element in Sorted Array**  
    Write a program to find whether a given element exists in a sorted array using binary search.

16. **Find Common Elements in Two Arrays**  
    Write a program to find the common elements between two arrays.

17. **Check if Array is Sorted**  
    Write a program to check if an array is sorted in ascending or descending order.

18. **Sum of Pairs**  
    Given an array of integers, find all pairs that sum up to a specific value.

### **Advanced Questions**

19. **Subarray with Given Sum**  
    Given an array of integers and a sum, find a continuous subarray whose sum is equal to the given sum.

20. **Largest Subarray with Equal Numbers of 0s and 1s**  
    Write a program to find the largest subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s.

21. **Product of Array Except Self**  
    Given an array of integers, return an array such that each element at index `i` is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at `i`.

22. **Find the Union of Two Arrays**  
    Write a program to find the union of two arrays (i.e., the set of distinct elements from both arrays).

23. **Find the Intersection of Two Arrays**  
    Write a program to find the intersection of two arrays (i.e., the set of common elements).

24. **Longest Increasing Subsequence**  
    Given an array, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

25. **Zigzag Array**  
    Write a program to rearrange an array such that the elements are in a zigzag pattern (i.e., smaller than the next and larger than the previous for odd positions).

26. **Array Subset Sum Problem**  
    Write a program to find if there exists a subset of the array whose sum is equal to a given number.

27. **Sliding Window Maximum**  
    Given an array and a number `k`, find the maximum element in every subarray of size `k`.

28. **Matrix Multiplication (2D Arrays)**  
    Write a program to multiply two matrices (2D arrays) and return the resulting matrix.

29. **Kth Smallest/Largest Element**  
    Given an array, find the `k`th smallest or largest element in the array.

30. **Rotate Matrix**  
    Write a program to rotate a given `n x n` matrix 90 degrees clockwise.

These questions are ordered from the most basic concepts to more challenging algorithms involving arrays. Let me know if you need solutions or explanations for any of them!
